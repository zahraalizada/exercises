### Moving House  #

I'd like to calculate how long on average I've lived in a single house.
Given a person's $age and the number of times they've moved house as $moves, return the average number of years that they've spent living in the same house.

yearsInOneHouse(30, 1) ➞ 15
yearsInOneHouse(15, 2) ➞ 5
yearsInOneHouse(80, 0) ➞ 80

Notes
-You can assume that the tests include people who've always lived in a house.
-Round to the nearest year.

*/

// ================= Solution =====================

function yearsInOneHouse($age, $moves) {
    return round($age / ($moves + 1));
}

echo yearsInOneHouse(80, 0);
?>
