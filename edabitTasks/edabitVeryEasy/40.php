###  I'd Like a New Shade of Blue, Please #

I have a bucket containing an amount of navy blue paint and I'd like to paint as many walls as possible. Create a function that returns the number of complete walls that I can paint, before I need to head to the shops to buy more.

$n is the number of square meters I can paint.
$w and $h are the widths and heights of a single wall in meters.


howManyWalls(100, 4, 5) ➞ 5
howManyWalls(10, 15, 12) ➞ 0
howManyWalls(41, 3, 6) ➞ 2

*/

// ================= Solution =====================

function howManyWalls($n, $w, $h) {
    return floor($n / ($w * $h));
}


echo howManyWalls(100, 4, 5);
?>
